# Homework #1

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables - think of it as an envelope labeled "allowance." The amount of money inside the envelope can change at any point but I always know where it is based on the name on the envelope. So pretend the envelope stands for a variable and in this case the name of that variable is "allowance." This allowance variable will stand for a quantity of money that can change at any point and wherever you use the variable in your code, you know it will always represent the current value (i.e., the current amount of allowance money you have in the variable/envelope).
	* Strings - a type of data that is used in programming which uses text.
	* Functions (arguments, `return`) - a set of instructions that can be reused. Your instructions can include variables that will be filled in by what are called arguments. Arguments provide extra information that fill in the blanks of the variables and effect the outcome, or return. 
	* `if` statements - 'if' statements let you do certain things ONLY if specific requirements are met.
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`) - boolean values is a data type that has two values that usually represent 'true' and 'false'.

6. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project. -- DONE


7. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `exercises.js` to make the tests pass. --DONE
